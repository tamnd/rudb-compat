# rudb-compat

The DuckDB compatibility harness for [rudb](https://github.com/tamnd/rudb).

This is the apparatus that turns "compatible with DuckDB" from an assertion into a number that a machine computed. Differential execution against a real DuckDB binary, weighted function and statement coverage, storage format round trips in both directions, and C ABI conformance generated from DuckDB's own header.

It is a separate repository for three reasons. It depends on DuckDB and on rudb at the same time, which no crate that ships should. It should be runnable by someone who trusts neither. And a compatibility suite that lives inside the implementation it tests is a suite whose failures are easy to explain away.

The design is [`spec/14-rudb-compat.md`](https://github.com/tamnd/rudb/blob/main/spec/14-rudb-compat.md) in the rudb repository, and the levels it reports against are [`spec/12-duckdb-compat.md`](https://github.com/tamnd/rudb/blob/main/spec/12-duckdb-compat.md) section 12.8.

## Status

Early. There is no engine to compare against yet, so nothing here runs a query. What exists is the shape of the report and the command line that will produce it. `rudb-compat levels` prints the four levels and the fact that none of them has been measured.

```
$ rudb-compat levels
level  name                    coverage  against
    0  data compatible          not run  nothing
    1  query compatible         not run  nothing
    2  API compatible           not run  nothing
    3  ecosystem compatible     not run  nothing

No suite has run. A level with no test behind it is not a claim, per section 14.1.
```

The real harness arrives with M2 in [`spec/17-milestones.md`](https://github.com/tamnd/rudb/blob/main/spec/17-milestones.md), which is the milestone where there is first a database to point it at.

## The principle

**No compatibility claim appears anywhere without a test that produced it.** Not in a README, not in a release note, not in a talk. Each of the four levels has a suite, each suite produces a percentage and a failure list, and both are published on every commit.

**The comparison is always against a real DuckDB binary of a named version**, run on the same data on the same machine. Not against documentation, not against remembered behavior, and not against a previous run. The surface moves between releases, so a percentage without a version attached to it does not mean anything.

**Errors are results.** A query that errors on DuckDB has to error here, with a matching code and, where it is specified, a matching message. Succeeding where DuckDB fails is a failure, the same as failing where DuckDB succeeds.

**Every failure is reduced and bisected automatically.** A forty-line generated query that returns the wrong answer tells you nothing about why. The harness shrinks it and then bisects it against the optimizer passes, so the report names the pass that introduced the difference. That is the single highest-value piece of tooling in here, because most wrong answers come from a rewrite and finding out which one by hand costs an afternoon each.

## The four levels

Rather than one binary claim, four named levels, each independently verified and published with its own status.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | data compatible | Reads and writes DuckDB files at full fidelity. The minimum useful claim, and the one that makes migration reversible. |
| 1 | query compatible | Level 0 plus the SQL dialect at a published weighted coverage. What most people mean when they say compatible. |
| 2 | API compatible | Level 1 plus the C API, so existing programs and language bindings work unmodified. |
| 3 | ecosystem compatible | Level 2 plus extensions loading and the wire protocol, with a per-extension status table. |

The weighting matters. A function nobody calls and a function in the top hundred by usage are the same amount of code and very different amounts of compatibility, so coverage is weighted by observed usage from a corpus of real queries rather than counted as a fraction of the function list. A function that differs on any tested input counts as not implemented, with no partial credit.

## Where the queries come from

Five sources, in increasing order of how much they find.

DuckDB's own `sqllogictest` corpus, which is tens of thousands of queries with expected results written by the people who know where the edges are. Running it is the highest-value first step and it is what M2 does.

The benchmark suites, which are modest in count and exercise real plan shapes.

A corpus of real queries scraped from public repositories and notebooks, which is what the usage weighting is computed from and which contains shapes nobody would have thought to generate.

Generated queries, from a grammar-based generator over a random schema, in the spirit of SQLancer and SQLsmith. This is where the volume is and where most of the wrong answers will come from.

Metamorphic queries, meaning transformations that have to preserve the result: a predicate rewritten to an equivalent form, a join reordered, an aggregation expressed two ways. These find bugs a random generator does not, because they produce pairs of queries whose relationship is known even when the correct answer is not.

## What this suite cannot do

It compares against DuckDB's behavior, so where DuckDB has a bug, matching it is what the suite rewards. That is mostly correct, because a user migrating depends on the behavior they have rather than the behavior that is right, but it means this is not a correctness suite. Correctness is covered separately in `spec/16-testing.md` and the two are not substitutes.

It cannot test what it does not generate. A grammar explores the space its author described, and the bugs that matter are often in the corners the author did not think of.

It cannot measure performance compatibility. A query that returns the right answer fifty times slower than DuckDB is a passing test and a failed product. That is [`tamnd/rudb-bench`](https://github.com/tamnd/rudb-bench), and the two should be read together.
